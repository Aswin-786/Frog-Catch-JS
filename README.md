# Frog-Catch

In this game, there are 9 boxes and a frog that moves randomly throughout the boxes. The objective is to catch the frog and score points. Each time you catch the frog, an audio clip plays to add to the excitement of the game. The game has a 30-second time limit, which adds an element of urgency to the gameplay.
